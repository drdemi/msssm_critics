# MATLAB FS12 â€“ Research Plan (in progress...)

 * Group Name: the critics
 * Group participants name: Xinyi Chen, Artemi Egorov, Pegah Kassraian Fard
 * Project Title: sandpile models in self-organized criticality
 
## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

 * What are the main characteristics of SOC?
 * Are cyclones a SOC system? 
 * Is it possible to model their criticality with cellula automaton?
 * If they are a critical system, how does a change of temperature (global warming) affect them?


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

 * Empirical evidences of power-law behavior of cyclones, so we expect them to be SOC and succeed to model it with a cellula automaton modelling.
 * Global warming should influence on them, maybe accelerating their formation, so we might have more cyclones, and/or making them more intense, so we might have bigger cyclones.
