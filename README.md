## General Introduction


Science endeavors to understand how the existing world works. Although particle physicists nowadays are approaching more than ever the most fundamental laws of Nature, this will not change essentialy the complexity nature of the real physical world, where the many-body systems are modelled as dynamical systems governed by highly non-linear equations that we barely know how to solve. However, simple rules might emerge, like the simple power-law in critical systems, or the nice fractal patterns, etc. 

We would like, thus, to study, in particular, "Self organized criticality (SOC)", which describes the tendency of strongly dissipative systems to drive themselves to a critical state, without any external tuning parameter, e.g. the temperature for an equilibrium thermodynamic system. This idea seems to provide a unifying large scale behaviour in systems with many degrees of freedom, as a complementary idea of 'Chaos', wherein simple systems with a small number of degrees of freedom display complex behaviour.

Despite nowadays many authors try to explain a vast range of systems with SOC, there seems to be none satisfying general understanding of SOC. Therefore, we will study the classical paradigm of the sandpile model in this project, as we aim at a better understanding of the SOC phenomenon. We will adopt the mean field approximation, which gives a comprehensive insight for SOC, and we will try to investigate the limit of SOC behavior in more physical sanpile models.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

At the end of the project we want to find the answer to these questions:

 * What are the main characteristics of SOC?
 * What different models do exist and what are their differences?
 ** sandpile model (main focus)
 ** forest fire model (FF)
 ** mean field approach (MF)
 * What are the possibilities/constraints of the sandpile model and how can we expand its functionality?
 * What benefits/insights can we gain from applying the mean field theory?
 * How do we implement SOC in a simulation environment?
 * What is the practical value of SOC and the related models and the sandpile model in particular?


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## Research Methods

* cellular automata (CA)
** a discrete model consisting of a regular grid with a finite number of cells in a finite number of dimensions, where the cells have a finite number of possible states.
* sandpile model
** a CA-model, where grains are randomly placed on the sites/cells until a specific threshold is exceeded, when the pile collapses and transfers the sand to the adjacent sites.
* mean field theory
** used to simplify a model with multiple interactions by replacing them with an average interaction
