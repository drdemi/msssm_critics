\section{Fractals}
As discussed in section \ref{sec:CAandSOC}, in order to show that a dynamical system exhibits SOC, some fractal nature must be present. As done analytically for a 1-D-model in \cite{fractal_avalanching}, we can plot the energy of a system over time according to the definition of normalized energy
\[
E(t) = \int_f h(x,y,t)^2 df
\]
where $h$ is the height of a site at position $(x,y)$ of the field $f$ at time $t$. In MATLAB/Octave, at the end of every main loop iteration the energy is calculated:
\begin{lstlisting}
ee(t) = sum(sum(f.^2));
\end{lstlisting}
As the energy series in 1-dimensional case shows fractal properties (see \cite{fractal_avalanching}), the question arises if this is true for a 2-dimensional case.
